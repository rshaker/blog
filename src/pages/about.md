Why would anyone ever start a blog nowadays? You've seen the Internet, it's full of
advertising sites melded with how-to's copied from someone else's site, and so on.
Noise is not something I cherish, and today's is a noisy world.

The purpose of this site is not to answer questions you can easily find on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), or to produce lengthy procedures
of system management gobbledygook. The posts here will be for entertainment,
potentially calling out interesting technologies, and including short examples
where applicable.

Luna will make sure of it.
